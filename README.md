This repository is the implementation of [1] with our improvement. 
It can generate the targeted adversarial attack audio for Google Speech Command Model.
The generated audio has less SNR and larger success rate compared to the original implementation.
The generated audio can affect other automatic speech recognization system according to our experiments.
Our improvement focuses on the Genetic Algorithm, which is the main algorithm that we use to generate noise.
We also use Labview to offer an API to interact with our server to calculate the results.
